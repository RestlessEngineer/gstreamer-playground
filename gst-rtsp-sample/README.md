# GSTREAMER RTSP SERVER

## Introduction

The Localization Filter is a simple example of how to utilize GStreamer rtsp server.

## Installation

To install the Localization Filter, follow these steps:

```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you do not want to use hardware codecs, you can disable them during the installation process. Here's how:

```
cmake -DENABLE_VA_API_CODECS=OFF ..
make
```

## Quick Start

To run the program, you need to supply three arguments:

1. **Server Address:** The address of the server where the program will run.
   
2. **Path to the Video File:** The file path to the video you want to play.

3. **Time Interval:** The time interval (in seconds) at which the videos will switch.

Here's an example of how to launch the program with these arguments:
```
./rtsp_server_sample 127.0.0.1 /path/to/your/video.mp4 15 

```

To view the video generated by the program, you can use the following GStreamer command in a separate terminal:

```
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/test ! rtph264depay ! decodebin ! autovideosink
```

for build with ENABLE_VA_API_CODECS=ON:
```
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/test ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! vaapih264dec ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```
